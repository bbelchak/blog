<p>I came across this little tip to re-enable the key repeat, and my life is measurably better (first world problems, I know&hellip;).</p>

<p>Run the following in your Terminal.app:</p>

<pre><code>$ defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
</code></pre>

<p>Then reboot, and you should be good to go!</p>
