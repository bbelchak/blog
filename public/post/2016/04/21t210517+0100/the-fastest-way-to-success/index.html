      <p>I recently heard a quote by <a href="https://twitter.com/TomZiglar">Tom Ziglar</a> on a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/ziglar-show-motivation-inspiration/id192820274?mt=2">Ziglar Show</a> podcast that went like this: <em>&ldquo;The fastest way to success is by replacing bad habits with good habits.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>This got me thinking. What kind of bad habits do I have, and what do I want to replace them with?</p>

<p>I started writing down a list of bad habits that I have, and discovered that a lot of them went like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m not very organized.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not in the physical shape I want to be in.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not holding people accountable for the results they produce like I wish I was.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not following through on the tasks I delegate as well as I&rsquo;d like.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not setting clear enough standards and expectations for myself and my team.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not &hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>I realized that most of these could easily be reversed into statements like:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m always getting better at being organized.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m working on my physical health and improving my fitness.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m holding people accountable for the results they produce.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m following through on the tasks I delegate.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m setting clear standards and expectations for myself and my team.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m &hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>Taken a step further, I&rsquo;m looking for little improvements for each of these areas each and every week. If I&rsquo;m targeting being more organized this week, maybe it means that I&rsquo;m working on writing down every task or commitment I make. Maybe I&rsquo;m focused on labeling my emails more accurately.</p>

<p>Soon, those small steps add up to big change as the new habits I&rsquo;m replacing the old habits with are becoming more and more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; to me, and I am gradually improving in the areas that I&rsquo;ve identified as places I want to improve.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no quick road to success, just hard work and perseverance.</p>
