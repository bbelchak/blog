      <description>A few months ago, I started investigating the health benefits of standing while I work at my computer. The benefits are myriad, and include:
 More calories burned. Standing at a desk while you work can actually burn around 300 calories per day more than sitting.
 Standing at a desk helps people with back problems. Humans were not made for sitting, and doing so for long periods of time can be really hard on your hips and lower back.</description>
